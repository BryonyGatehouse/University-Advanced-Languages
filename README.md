# Advanced Programming Languages

This course applies a range of advanced contemporary programming languages in current use, covering practical programming skills in the languages as well as their niches and design paradigms. The course will cover languages of present industrial interest, along with design trends of future languages.

### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course should be able to:
1. Program in a range of advanced contemporary programming languages with industrial relevance.
2. Select appropriate implementation languages for a program based on their properties, and justify the contributing factors and trade-offs involved.
3. Understand the relationship between different programming language paradigms, features, and tooling.

### Assessment

The same project was repeated for each new language, allowing the student to focus on learning the language rather than struggling to create a solution to the project. After a report was written reflecting on the language's abilities and suitability to the project.
